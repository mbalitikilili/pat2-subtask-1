What is a Morse code?
A Morse code is a way to send messages using dots (.) and dashes (–).
Each letter of the alphabet and each number is made with a special pattern of dots and dashes. For example:
A = .–
B = –...
C = –.–.
Morse code is just a simple way to spell out words using short and long signals.


Why Morse code was created?
Morse code was created to send messages over long distances before telephones and the internet existed.
In the early 1800s, people needed a fast way to communicate far away, especially for trains, the military, and emergencies. Samuel Morse and his team invented Morse code in the 1830s to work with the telegraph—a machine that sent electric signals through wires.
Since you couldn’t send voices or pictures, they used short (dot) and long (dash) signals to represent letters and numbers. This allowed people to send and receive messages quickly using sound or light.
Therefore, Morse code was created to send messages using simple signals when other communication tools didn’t exist.


Explain how the Morse code system works, including the use of dots and dashes?
Morse code works by using a system of dots (.) and dashes (–) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. These are called signals.
How it works:
Each character has its own pattern
For example:
A = .- (dot dash)
B = -... (dash dot dot dot)
C = -.-. (dash dot dash dot)
1 = .----
2 = ..---
Dots are short signals, represents a beep or flash.
Dashes are longer signals, represents a longer beep or flash.
Space between letters = pause (equal to 3 dots)
Space between words = longer pause (equal to 7 dots)
